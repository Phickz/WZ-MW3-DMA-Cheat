Hi there!

Me and mc_cheat have been working on this old external source (credits to idk).
We have updated it with the latest offsets for battle.net.

I've tried to run the cheat, but there's something wrong with it, we just couldn't find out what. Hence why I am posting this updated source, so people could work on it and perhaps maybe help us and the WZ cheating community!
